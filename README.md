# Doctor-Consultantcy-Fees-Prediction-
Summary:
This project focuses on predicting doctors' consultancy fees using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. By analyzing and visualizing relevant data, we aim to estimate the fees that doctors charge for their services. The project primarily leverages K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Regressor algorithms to calculate the R-squared score, a measure of predictive accuracy. By doing so, we provide a valuable tool for patients and healthcare institutions to gain insights into and anticipate doctors' consultation fees, facilitating informed decision-making in the healthcare sector.

Key Components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into the features and relationships that impact doctors' consultancy fees.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest Regressor to create predictive models.
Evaluation: Calculating the R-squared score to assess the models' predictive accuracy.
